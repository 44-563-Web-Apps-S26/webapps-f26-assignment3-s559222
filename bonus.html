    <h1>Powerful Panther and Parker</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Powerful Panther</strong> is a fearless superhero who protects
        the city with incredible strength, speed, and sharp instincts.
        Inspired by the panther’s agility, he moves silently and reacts
        quickly to threats. His sidekick, <strong>Parker</strong>, is a clever
        tech expert who builds gadgets and monitors danger across the city.
